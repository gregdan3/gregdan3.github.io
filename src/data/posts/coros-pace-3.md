I had tried to get into running for well over a year before getting this watch. It never worked for me, I'd always wear myself out within half a mile and give up. Did you know I figured out what my problem was the first time I ran with this watch? It was so simple it was almost funny. I was starting out at a ridiculous low 7 minute pace. Did you know my second run with this watch, I got through 4.5 miles at a 10:40 pace and it was comfortable the whole way? It felt fantastic.

Features to follow. But the above is the most important to me. I can't thank Coros enough for the simple insight that I was just _trying too hard._

- GPS is perfect. It ticks miles exactly where my favorite trail is marked, and is equally as accurate as my friend's watch- she has a Forerunner. The fancy, expensive one that the Pace 3 competes with. I uh, try not to gloat, but I'm pretty pleased with the purchase.
- The training data gives me more insight into my exercise than I ever had before. When my watch first said my recovery time was 16 hours, I was in disbelief. You're telling me I could be rested enough to do this run again tomorrow? Turns out the answer was, yes! There's nuance to that, but yes. If I had been left without the numbers, I would've rested for two more days before going out on another run.
- On that note, the personal training features are phenomenal. I'm not at the point of doing super serious running- although I am doing my first 5k two days after writing this- but the training features are enormously informative, and give me more confidence in my running than I ever would have had on my own.

Wishlist:

- Give me an API to fetch my running data from! I know I can export it to Strava and _basically_ do that, but I don't wanna have two apps installed when one of them will do virtually nothing.
- Can it track non-running exercises a little better? I'd love to include my yoga and strength training on it too, but those are tracked so poorly that I don't feel the data is doing me much good. It could be that I'm doing something wrong and don't know what- but given the watch has exercise plans and tracking for such a wide variety of exercises, it surprises me a bit that I can't get it to do much outside running.
