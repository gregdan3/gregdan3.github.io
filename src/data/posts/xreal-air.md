In January of 2023, something happened inside my neck. I'm still not sure what. I started having serious nerve pain, brain fog, inability to focus, and a laundry list of other nasty intermittent problems. It affected my work, my hobbies, my personal life- essentially everything I wanted or needed to do was affected in some way, covered in this malaise of, oh no, my neck hurts and now I can't think.

I spent the following year and a half trying nearly everything to help the issue- and I still don't have a clear answer for how to fix it! But I did find one thing that helps immensely: In April, I purchased the [Xreal Air AR Glasses](TODO), then called the Nreal Air.

I think it's pretty badass but it's honestly not a big upgrade over the Xreal Air! Those already do 90hz and actually got HUGE tracking improvements over a few updates

6 months ago they were basically worthless

Today? If the Air 2 is priced only a little higher, the extra features are worth

That said, there is still no Linux support

And the comfort of wearing the air 1 for more than maybe half an hour is pretty bad, especially with corrective lenses

Ok, "no Linux support"

You can plug the glasses in and they will go to their default mode of being a competent but slightly weird external screen

No tracking, just bolted in center of vision, which is better than them not working

But no theater sized display or multiple display emulation

A few months ago, yeah

They wanna get in on that mixed reality

Plus Nreal is kinda a weird name

Although Xreal isn't much better, it does at least get in on the starpower of literally the letter X, and imply mixed reality is on the way

My opinion of AR glasses is that unless you have lots of downtime in your day like riding a bus, or you have a serious need for privacy, or you're willing to look like a dork in a coffee shop (I am of course), they aren't worth it

Gregory Danielson, [10/31/23 8:25 AM]

You can't really use your laptop display while using the glasses unless you keep turning them off and back on or side eyeing the laptop

And you only get multiple tracking-shown displays in windows/macos

I imagine you'd look even dorkier turning your head left and right to look at different virtual displays

Gregory Danielson, [10/31/23 8:27 AM]

They also aren't great for walking around in

The reflection of the ground into your eyes will screw your display quality and vision during the day

And the brightness of the display will screw your vision at night

They are not for mixed reality and really aren't gonna be capable of it ever because of the reasonable physical limitations of being a tiny projector built into a pair of glasses

So, they're kinda bad at everything except if you want a bigger display and don't have the room for it

That niche exists and makes them worthwhile for, say, people who travel a lot or take public transit

This is the summary lol
