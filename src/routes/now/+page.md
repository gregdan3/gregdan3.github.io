# Winter

#### December

- I'm getting back into video making, starting with finishing [my Toki Pona lesson series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoLQoll2U6WEeCO7C2oc1LTWgkoBC8rvT).
- My birthday is coming up this month. Unsure what to do about it. Maybe run a 5k? That seems to be my thing lately
- I ran an 8k on the 2nd and got a [44:15.7](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/113352/IndividualResult/bZqJ#U80855384), an 8:51 average pace over 5 miles! Absolutely ecstatic considering my first serious run was October 22nd- 41 days prior, or just under 6 weeks.

# Fall

#### November

- I got an in-progress version of this site up on [beta.gregdan3.dev](https://beta.gregdan3.dev).
- I went to a gay wedding on the 18th! Congratulations to them both, and thank you for being incredible.
- I ran my first ever 5k on the 11th and got a [26:27](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/153664/IndividualResult/gLZG?resultSetId=420758#U80855384)!
- I updated my [fanart page](https://mun.la/fanart) with the help of a friend from the Toki Pona community.

#### October

<!-- - I went and saw [Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show) with some friends- I went as [Eddie](https://rockyhorror.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie) -->

- I picked up on rewriting [this site](https://gregdan3.dev) again, and I'm going to take it to the finish line.
- I signed up for my first ever [5k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run). I wasn't sure if I could actually run all the way to the finish line when I signed up, but I managed a 4.5 mile run a few days later- I'll be fine!
- I got a CT Scan! Long story, but I'm mostly okay. It's weird to see the inside of your own body.
- I played a translation of [Zelda 1](https://youtu.be/SkiiabwexcA) in Toki Pona!

<summary>Older Content</summary>

I keep track of the most recent three months at a time, and everything older is stashed in here.

#### September

- I got my [ilo pi toki pona taso](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-pi-toki-pona-taso), "Only-Toki-Pona tool", ready for everyone to use! I immediately regretted some of my database design choices, but hey, you can't win them all.
- I started doing yoga. It's been as big a change in my well-being as the gym and physical therapy were before it- I can move and feel comfortable in my body far more than before, with 45 minute sessions twice a week.

# Summer

#### August

- My brother and I have been messing with [Ham Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_Radio) a lot, so we went to [Huntsville Hamfest](https://hamfest.org/) and got some gear! I got a [Xiegu X6100](https://www.radioddity.com/products/xiegu-x6100) and a [Comet HFJ-350M](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/cma-hfj-350m). A friend was also kind enough to sell us her [Icom IC-718](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/ico-ic-718) for cheap. We tried [making our own antennas](https://youtu.be/oR1UXAZTucU) too- it's surprising how easy that is.
- I bought a new car! A [2023 Hyundai Elantra](). Took me long enough; I'd been driving a piece of junk for ages.
- I delivered my... Presentation? Gag? for [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2023/). See it [here](https://youtu.be/_awfcwuJhpk) and [here](https://youtu.be/AgkDx8dIAio)!

#### July

- I got myself a Thinkpad x280 to serve as a distraction-reducing writing laptop. Highly recommended! It's like, $100 on eBay.
- I started going to the gym at my university a few times a week, which has had an enormous impact on my day to day well-being and strength. I can't recommend it enough.

#### June

- I started going to physical therapy, primarily for my neck. It's taught me a lot about how complex and inter-linked the systems of the body are, how sensitive they are, and how difficult they are to change.
- I traveled to DC to attend a meetup of Toki Pona speakers in North America. It was one of the highlights of my entire year- and about the only place I could speak Toki Pona and nothing else for a full day.

# Spring

#### May

- I traveled to Pittsburgh to officiate the wedding of two new friends, who I met because of Toki Pona and [VRChat](https://vrchat.com)! I'm probably the only person in the world with both the skill in Toki Pona and the energy-of-personality to fill this role, and I'm so glad I could for them.

#### April

- I bought some AR Glasses, the [Nreal Airs](https://www.nreal.ai/) to be exact. They're a painfully incomplete product, barely in beta despite the marketing.

#### March

- I traveled to Houston to attend the wedding of two old friends from college. Congratulations to them both!
