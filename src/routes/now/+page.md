<!---->
<!-- - I'm traveling to Chicago to see a BIG crowd of toki pona speakers! -->

## Fall

#### September

- I'm getting out a very important video for the future of Toki Pona.
- I published [a very silly video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fc4QjYbONps) thanks
  to ijo Vivi!

## Summer

#### August

- I published [ilo Muni pi mute nimi](https://gregdan3.github.io/ilo-muni/), a graphing
  tool in the style of [Google Ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) to view the
  history of Toki Pona!
- I'm finally getting back to running- it was so frustrating to be out for so
  long, but it turns out that my ankle pain is entirely in my head. Not a joke.

#### July

- I received an old, old laptop I had when I was a child from my parents, and oh _man_
  does it suck. But incredibly, it still works! It's an HP ze5500
- I started graphing the frequency-counted words from [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute), demonstrating some fascinating

#### June

- I travelled to Chicago for a big toki pona meetup- it was so much fun. I finally got
  to meet some people I'd only spoken to over the internet- always exciting!
- I made some software, [sona mute](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-mute) "frequency knowledge," which takes in toki pona text
  from various sources and frequency-counts it.

<summary>Older Content</summary>

I keep track of the most recent three months at a time, and everything older is stashed in here.

## Spring

#### May

- I started [streaming in Toki Pona on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@gregdan3d/streams), which has been incredibly fun! Also, play Animal Well!
- I updated [my toki pona site, mun.la](https://mun.la) to render on a Dreamcast or
  Nintendo DS, and with some cool new graphics too!
- I published a Python library called [sona toki](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-toki/) "language knowledge," which helps you determine if a given text is or is not Toki Pona.
- I had one bad run right at the start of the month, then had left calf pain for a week and nasty ankle pain afterward that prevented me from running. Damn, and I was planning on a marathon in October.

#### April

- I traveled to Arkansas to see the total solar eclipse, and it was genuinely
  incredible. I think about it very often.
- The morning of April 5th, I ran 7 miles at an average pace of 8:43- this was my 5k pace in October, and just short of my 10k pace only a month ago.
- I released an April Fools video for the Toki Pona community, [tomo pi walo loje](https://youtu.be/liZCeOD9-gI)
- At the same time, I helped [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) become kiku tiki tuki tiki- circle place of [circle language](https://tiger.kittycat.homes/made/conlang/tuki-tiki/cheat-sheet.pdf)!

#### March

- My girlfriend and I went to the [Cherry Blossom Festival](https://japanalabama.com/Cherry-Blossom-Festival) at the Botanical Gardens; it was absolutely lovely, though I wish there were more cherry blossoms.
- I ran a half marathon on the 23rd, and got a time of [1:59:59](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/102420/IndividualResult/gsqK?resultSetId=444401#U80855384)!
- I had an AWESOME toki pona meetup in Birmingham with two very welcome visitors from Florida and Ohio!
- I ran a 10k on the 2nd, and got a time of [53:48](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/27993/IndividualResult/gZtq#U80855384)!

## Winter

#### February

- I ran 13.1 miles for the first time on the 25th. 2:12:14. Let's GO!
- I did a valentine's day themed toki pona lesson for the VR community!
- I've been slowly upping my mileage in runs for a while, so I've decided it's time to run a half marathon! I'm working up my long runs now, just did 9.5 miles on the 3rd. It's two months out!
- I started a new job, sorta! I do the same things, in the same building, for mostly the same people, but for higher pay. Cool!

#### January

- I traveled to San Francisco for a meetup of Toki Pona speakers! Not as big as the DC one last summer, but just as fun- and longer this time! 6 full days, almost exclusively speaking Toki Pona.
- We're running a contest to update the icon and banner in [ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona)!
- We're writing a proposal to add sitelen pona, Toki Pona's writing system, to Unicode! It's a huge effort across the community, although there are surprisingly few writers in total.

#### December

- I finished my first work as a Toki Pona freelancer for jan Sonja! Secret project though, no peeking!
- Had my birthday! I'm 26 now. I spent most of the day relaxing. Baldur's Gate 3 is fantastic (thanks mom)
- [kulupu Linku is now up on Crowdin!](https://linku.crowdin.com)
- I finished the basic design on my website. Now comes content, the hardest part of making a website.
<!-- - I'm getting back into video making, starting with finishing [my Toki Pona lesson series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoLQoll2U6WEeCO7C2oc1LTWgkoBC8rvT). -->
- I've been working on a re-design for kulupu Linku's datastore, now [sona Linku](https://github.com/lipu-linku/sona)
- I ran an 8k on the 2nd and got a [44:15.7](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/113352/IndividualResult/bZqJ#U80855384), 8:51 pace over 5 miles! Feels great when my first serious run was October 22nd- 41 days before, or 6 weeks.

## Fall

#### November

- I got an in-progress version of this site up on [beta.gregdan3.dev](https://beta.gregdan3.dev).
- I went to a gay wedding on the 18th! Congratulations to them both, and thank you for being incredible.
- I ran my first ever 5k on the 11th and got a [26:27](https://runsignup.com/Race/Results/153664/IndividualResult/gLZG?resultSetId=420758#U80855384)!
- I updated my [fanart page](https://mun.la/fanart) with the help of a friend from the Toki Pona community.

#### October

<!-- - I went and saw [Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show) with some friends- I went as [Eddie](https://rockyhorror.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie) -->

- I picked up on rewriting [this site](https://gregdan3.dev) again, and I'm going to take it to the finish line.
- I signed up for my first ever [5k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run). I wasn't sure if I could actually run all the way to the finish line when I signed up, but I managed a 4.5 mile run a few days later- I'll be fine!
- I got a CT Scan! Long story, but I'm mostly okay. It's weird to see the inside of your own body.
- I played a translation of [Zelda 1](https://youtu.be/SkiiabwexcA) in Toki Pona!

#### September

- I got my [ilo pi toki pona taso](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-pi-toki-pona-taso), "Only-Toki-Pona tool", ready for everyone to use! I immediately regretted some of my database design choices, but hey, you can't win them all.
- I started doing yoga. It's been as big a change in my well-being as the gym and physical therapy were before it- I can move and feel comfortable in my body far more than before, with 45 minute sessions twice a week.
- I'm working on a refresh of the definitions in [lipu Linku](https://linku.la) with help from lots of others. See [here](https://github.com/lipu-linku/pali-nimi/) for details!

## Summer

#### August

- My brother and I have been messing with [Ham Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_Radio) a lot, so we went to [Huntsville Hamfest](https://hamfest.org/) and got some gear! I got a [Xiegu X6100](https://www.radioddity.com/products/xiegu-x6100) and a [Comet HFJ-350M](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/cma-hfj-350m). A friend was also kind enough to sell us her [Icom IC-718](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/ico-ic-718) for cheap. We tried [making our own antennas](https://youtu.be/oR1UXAZTucU) too- it's surprising how easy that is.
- I bought a new car! A [2023 Hyundai Elantra](). Took me long enough; I'd been driving a piece of junk for ages.
- I delivered my... Presentation? Gag? for [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2023/). See it [here](https://youtu.be/_awfcwuJhpk) and [here](https://youtu.be/AgkDx8dIAio)!

#### July

- I got myself a Thinkpad x280 to serve as a distraction-reducing writing laptop. Highly recommended! It's like, $100 on eBay.
- I started going to the gym at my university a few times a week, which has had an enormous impact on my day to day well-being and strength. I can't recommend it enough.

#### June

- I started going to physical therapy, primarily for my neck. It's taught me a lot about how complex and inter-linked the systems of the body are, how sensitive they are, and how difficult they are to change.
- I traveled to DC to attend a meetup of Toki Pona speakers in North America. It was one of the highlights of my entire year- and about the only place I could speak Toki Pona and nothing else for a full day.
- I put out a video with a toki pona taso section, all about the variety of ways you can describe a jellyfish! [See it here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ituR4S-NS0)

## Spring

#### May

- I traveled to Pittsburgh to officiate the wedding of two new friends, who I met because of Toki Pona and [VRChat](https://vrchat.com)! I'm probably the only person in the world with both the skill in Toki Pona and the energy-of-personality to fill this role, and I'm so glad I could for them.

#### April

- I bought some AR Glasses, the [Nreal Airs](https://www.nreal.ai/) to be exact. They're a painfully incomplete product, barely in beta despite the marketing.
- I did some AWESOME april fools gags [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ywy9Fa8wcOI) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxe0cHuSBG4), as well as turning ma pona pi toki pona into ma Losupan pi toki Losupan!

#### March

- I published my multiple li/e, en, anu lesson, [check it out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGsodPu9UAw)
- I traveled to Houston to attend the wedding of two old friends from college. Congratulations to them both!

## Winter

#### February

- I published a lesson on names, numbers, and kin! [Check it out!](https://youtu.be/P0N1S5jBujI)
- I dubbed waso mu's comic ["mi lon e ma"](https://waso-mu.neocities.org/musi/), [see it here!](https://youtu.be/GU9PEZ9TARs)

#### January

- I played through the first part of waso Keli's translation of Link's Awakening! [See it here](https://youtu.be/xi8gUvqyMm4)!
