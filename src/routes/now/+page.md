# Fall

#### November

- I'm going to a wedding mid-month! Two close friends from much later in college.
- I'm running that 5k on the 11th!
- I updated my [fanart page](https://mun.la/fanart) with the help of a friend from the Toki Pona community.

#### October

<!-- - I went and saw [Rocky Horror Picture Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rocky_Horror_Picture_Show) with some friends- I went as [Eddie](https://rockyhorror.fandom.com/wiki/Eddie) -->

- I picked up on rewriting [this site](https://gregdan3.dev) again, and I'm going to take it to the finish line.
- I signed up for my first ever [5k](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5K_run). I wasn't sure if I could actually run all the way to the finish line when I signed up, but I managed a 4.5 mile run a few days later- I'll be fine!
<!-- - I got a CT Scan! Long story, but I'm okay. It's weird to see the inside of your own body, especially your skull and brain. -->
- I played a translation of [Zelda 1](https://youtu.be/SkiiabwexcA) in Toki Pona!

#### September

- I got my [ilo pi toki pona taso](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-pi-toki-pona-taso), "Only-Toki-Pona tool", ready for everyone to use! I immediately regretted some of my database design choices, but hey, you can't win them all.
- I started doing yoga. It's been as big a change in my well-being as the gym and physical therapy were before it- I can move and feel comfortable in my body far more than before, with 45 minute sessions twice a week.

<summary>Older Content</summary>

I keep track of the most recent three months at a time, and everything older is stashed in here.

# Summer

#### August

- My brother and I have been messing with [Ham Radio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ham_Radio) a lot, so we went to [Huntsville Hamfest](https://hamfest.org/) and got some gear! I got a [Xiegu X6100](https://www.radioddity.com/products/xiegu-x6100) and a [Comet HFJ-350M](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/cma-hfj-350m). A friend was also kind enough to sell us her [Icom IC-718](https://www.dxengineering.com/parts/ico-ic-718) for cheap. We tried [making our own antennas](https://youtu.be/oR1UXAZTucU) too- it's surprising how easy that is.
- I bought a new car! A [2023 Hyundai Elantra](). Took me long enough; I'd been driving a piece of junk for ages.
- I delivered my... Presentation? Gag? for [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2023/). See it [here](https://youtu.be/_awfcwuJhpk) and [here](https://youtu.be/AgkDx8dIAio)!

#### July

- I got myself a Thinkpad x280 to serve as a distraction-reducing writing laptop. Highly recommended! It's like, $100 on eBay.
- I started going to the gym at my university a few times a week, which has had an enormous impact on my day to day well-being and strength. I can't recommend it enough.

#### June

- I started going to physical therapy, primarily for my neck. It's taught me a lot about how complex and inter-linked the systems of the body are, how sensitive they are, and how difficult they are to change.
- I traveled to DC to attend a meetup of Toki Pona speakers in North America. It was one of the highlights of my entire year- and about the only place I could speak Toki Pona and nothing else for a full day.

# Spring

#### May

- I traveled to Pittsburgh to officiate the wedding of two new friends, who I met because of Toki Pona and [VRChat](https://vrchat.com)! I'm probably the only person in the world with both the skill in Toki Pona and the energy-of-personality to fill this role, and I'm so glad I could for them.

#### April

- I bought some AR Glasses, the [Nreal Airs](https://www.nreal.ai/) to be exact. They're really painfully in beta right now.

#### March

- I traveled to Houston to attend the wedding of two old friends from college. Congratulations to them both!
