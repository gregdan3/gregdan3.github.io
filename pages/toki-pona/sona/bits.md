## Overview

This lesson is a big collection of quickly explained but unrelated ideas, right before the final act!

#### Proper Names

::: info

Toki Pona has a way to use names, but try _not_ using them. You'll learn a lot!

:::

In Toki Pona, you can refer to things by their name. To do this, you start with describing the thing. What kind of thing is this? Languages are `toki`, games are `musi`, and people are usually `jan`! Then you can use the name right after, like any kind of modifier.

<details><summary> mi lon ma Kanse! </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

When written in latin characters, proper names are always capitalized at the start.

<details><summary> [mi lon ma [kiwen alasa nasin sewi esun]]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm in France!

</details>

In [sitelen pona]{.tokipona}, proper names are written in a box, then spelled by reading the first letter of each symbol in the box. Here we spell out "Kanse," which is what France is called in Toki Pona!

::: info

Toki Pona lets people and places name themselves! For example, Japan is called "にほん (Nihon)" by Japanese speakers, so in Toki Pona, Japan is called **ma Nijon**.

:::

#### Numbers

::: info

Toki Pona has numbers, but they aren't important! If there are lots of things, use [mute]{.tokipona}. If there are a few things, try [mute lili]{.tokipona}, or nothing at all! Numbers aren't important in Toki Pona.

:::

Toki Pona has two numbers: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona}. If you read those out, it should sound like the same numbers from English: one (1) and two (2).

<details><summary> [o kama jo e ilo tu wan]{.tokipona} </summary>

Pick up three (3, 2+1) tools.

Go get three (3, 2+1) tools.

</details>

When counting things, you use numbers as modifiers. So in this example, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is like having a modifier that means "three."

[wan]{.tokipona} is one, [tu]{.tokipona} is two, [tu wan]{.tokipona} is three, [tu tu]{.tokipona} is four, and [tu tu wan]{.tokipona} is five. This keeps going, which gets long quickly! Try [mute]{.tokipona} instead of a bunch of [tu]{.tokipona} and [wan]{.tokipona}.

By the way: [wan]{.tokipona} and [tu]{.tokipona} are normal content words with meanings besides numbers:

<details><summary> [mi wan e lipu ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I combined all the papers.

I united all the documents.

</details>

<details><summary> [soweli li tu e moku tawa pana]{.tokipona} </summary>

The animal divided up the food to gift.

The critter split up the food to give away.

</details>

You can also use the word [nanpa]{.tokipona} to rank things. [nanpa wan]{.tokipona} is often used to refer to favorites, like this:

<details><summary> [ni li pona nanpa wan tawa mi]{.tokipona} </summary>

This is my favorite!

This is the best good thing, to me!

</details>

For this, [nanpa]{.tokipona} works like [pi]{.tokipona} because it groups the words after it into one modifier- even if there is only one word after it! The new modifier is a rank, like "first" or "third."

---

If you _really, really_ want to use bigger and more specific numbers, there is a system with more numbers than one and two.

Counting with this system works exactly as before, except you have bigger numbers to use:

::: tpdefinitions

<!-- this is a hack lmao -->

| Glyph | Word | Number            |
| ----- | ---- | ----------------- |
| wan   | wan  | One (1)           |
| tu    | tu   | Two (2)           |
| luka  | luka | Five (5)          |
| mute  | mute | Twenty (20)       |
| ale   | ale  | One Hundred (100) |

:::

Here are some quick examples:

<details><summary> [sina jo e kasi mute luka tu]{.tokipona} </summary>

You have twenty seven (27, 20+5+2) plants.

</details>

<details><summary> [jan ale ale wan li lon]{.tokipona} </summary>

There are two hundred and one (201, 100+100+1) people here.

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu luka luka luka]{.tokipona} </summary>

I've read fifteen (15, 5+5+5) books.

</details>

#### Multiple li, e, pi, and more

##### en

#### anu

We introduced [anu]{.tokipona} for questions before, in the phrase [anu seme]{.tokipona}. But it can be used similarly to the word "or" in English!

#### kin

[kin]{.tokipona} makes something additional or extra to something else. It's like saying "too" in English.

You can use it in subjects, predicates, objects, and prep phrases:

<details><summary> [mi kin li wile ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

I (and somebody else) also want to do this!

</details>

<details><summary> [kasi li loje kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

This plant is red (and another color), too!

</details>

<details><summary> [mi lukin e lipu kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

I read this book (and read something else).

</details>

<details><summary> [ona li pana e ni tawa sina kin]{.tokipona} </summary>

They gave this to you (and somebody else), too

</details>

When something is extra, it means there is another thing happening besides the thing being said!

#### funny nanpa

- [nanpa poka]{.tokipona} - A close by ranking- could be ahead or behind!
- [nanpa open]{.tokipona} and [nanpa pini]{.tokipona} - similar to "first" and "last"
- [nanpa pan]{.tokipona} The "bread"-th ranking! Not a literal rank, or done jokingly.
