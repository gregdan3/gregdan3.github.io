## Overview

**Pre-predicates**, also known as **pre-verbs** or **pre-preds**, are special modifiers that go at the start of the predicate.

There are seven pre-preds in common use. We already know some of them as normal content words!

#### Every Pre-predicate

---

##### wile

<details><summary> [mi wile pali]{.tokipona} </summary>

I want to create.

I want to work.

</details>

The [wile]{.tokipona} pre-pred means the predicate is wanted or needed.

You could say:

> [mi wile e pali]{.tokipona}

And that _could_ mean the same thing. But it's more clear to say [mi wile pali]{.tokipona}.

::: info

When something is in the object, it is often considered _not_ an action. If you want to talk about a wanted _action_, ensuring that word is in the **predicate** is the most clear!

:::

---

##### ken

<details><summary> [mi ken wawa]{.tokipona} </summary>

I can be strong.

</details>

The [ken]{.tokipona} pre-pred means the predicate is an ability or permission. Consider this version:

> [ken mi li wawa]{.tokipona}

Again, this has a similar meaning to the original statement that used a pre-predicate.

::: info

You can often restate a sentence _without_ a pre-predicate. Using pre-predicates saves time and makes you more clear!

:::

---

##### kama

<details><summary> [sina kama sona]{.tokipona} </summary>

You are learning!

</details>

The [kama]{.tokipona} pre-pred means the predicate is beginning, or _progressive_.
It's similar to a word in English that ends with "-ing," such as learning or growing.
It can also refer to beginning actions, such as going to sleep.

<details><summary> [kasi li kama suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant is growing!

The plant is becoming huge!

</details>

<details><summary> [jan lili li kama lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

The child goes to sleep.

</details>

---

##### awen

<details><summary> [mi awen kute]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am still listening.

</details>

The [awen]{.tokipona} pre-pred means the predicate is on-going, continuing, or not changing. This is different from [kama]{.tokipona} in that the [kama]{.tokipona} pre-pred does imply change!

You can still restate this without the pre-predicate:

> [mi awen e kute mi]{.tokipona}

But still, the predicate version is most clear to the "listening" meaning.

---

##### sona

<details><summary> [ona li sona pakala e ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

::: warning

You can't always tell apart a normal predicate from a pre-predicate. Pay attention to context!

:::

**Pre-predicate [sona]{.tokipona}**: They know how to break this.

**Predicate [sona]{.tokipona}**: They poorly understand this.

</details>

The [sona]{.tokipona} pre-pred means the predicate indicates knowledge of how to perform the action.
[mi sona pali]{.tokipona} is like saying "I know how to create." Consider this:

> [mi sona e pali]{.tokipona}

The same action-versus-thing distinction happens as with the [ken]{.tokipona} pre-pred. If something is an action, or knowledge of an action, that will be better understood in the predicate.

---

##### alasa / lukin

<details><summary> [mi alasa pona e sina  /  mi lukin pona e sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm trying to help you!

</details>

Lastly, there's [alasa]{.tokipona} and [lukin]{.tokipona}, which have the same meaning as pre-preds: to try. I recommend [alasa]{.tokipona} most, but feel free to use both!

::: info

[alasa]{.tokipona} and [lukin]{.tokipona} mean the same as pre-preds because Toki Pona has changed over time, even as a constructed language!

:::

---

Here are some extra notes on pre-predicates before you continue:

::: info

You can use a pre-predicate with itself in the predicate, such as saying [mi wile wile]{.tokipona}! This is not common, because the pre-predicate usually does what you need.

:::

::: warning

We can't ignore pre-predicates like we ignored modifiers before. They _do_ change the predicate, where modifiers just make it more specific!

:::

<!-- ::: warning -->

<!-- Pre-predicates _are_ modifiers, but you don't need to use pi or another word to connect them to the predicate! -->

<!-- ::: -->

<!-- ::: error -->

<!-- You **cannot** use modifiers or pi on pre-predicates. pi only applies to heads and normal mods- if you use pi, your pre-predicate will be read as a normal head or mod. -->

<!-- ::: -->

#### Multiple pre-predicates

Like modifiers, you can use multiple pre-predicates at once!

<details><summary> [mi awen ken mama e kasi]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am still able to raise plants.

I am still able to grow plants.

</details>

- [awen]{.tokipona} means something is ongoing
- [ken]{.tokipona} means something is an ability
- [mama]{.tokipona} is the predicate, making this a parenting action.

The order of pre-predicates matters. Consider this:

<details><summary> [mi ken awen mama e kasi]{.tokipona} </summary>

I am able to continue raising plants.

</details>

Multiple pre-predicates apply from left to right. The thing that is [ken]{.tokipona} is the [awen mama]{.tokipona}, and the thing that is [awen]{.tokipona} is [mama]{.tokipona}.

In the original, the thing that is [awen]{.tokipona} is [ken mama]{.tokipona}, and the thing that is [ken]{.tokipona} is [mama]{.tokipona}.

#### ala

[ala]{.tokipona} has a simple function: negate the previous word or phrase.

<details><summary> [mi pona ala]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm not well.

I'm not good.

</details>

Here, [pona]{.tokipona} is negated by [ala]{.tokipona}- it's like saying "not".

::: warning

Toki Pona words don't have opposites. There are some uses of [pona]{.tokipona} opposite to uses of [ike]{.tokipona}, but [pona ala]{.tokipona} is _not_ [ike]{.tokipona}.

:::

Compare the phrases "this is good" and "this is not bad" in English. They can be close in meaning, but the negation does not make them the same.

<details><summary> [jan ala li ante e lipu]{.tokipona} </summary>

Nobody changed the book.

A non-person changed the book.

::: warning

Two interpretations are possible here! The first means the book was unchanged, and the second means something other than a person changed the book. If you want to be clear that the book is unchanged, try [lipu li ante ala.]{.tokipona}

:::

</details>

::: info

[ala]{.tokipona} can be a normal modifier! If it is, it applies nothingness to the thing it modifies. This is a rare case though!

:::

You can also use [ala]{.tokipona} in pre-predicates:

<details><summary> [kasi li kama ala ike]{.tokipona} </summary>

The plant did not get hurt!

The plant did not become unpleasant.

</details>

And in [pi]{.tokipona} phrases:

<details><summary> [ona li jan pi pana ala]{.tokipona} </summary>

They are not a giving person.

They are not a gift giver.

</details>

::: info

Stick to negating **predicates**, **modifiers**, and **pre-predicates**. Easy to understand!

## Exercises

### Toki Pona to English

#### One pre-pred

A teacher is trying to communicate to all of his students that recess is over, and everyone needs to come inside. He sends a nearby student with a message for everyone to group up in the classroom:

<details><summary> [jan sona li wile kulupu e jan pi kama sona]{.tokipona} </summary>

The teacher wants to group together all the students!

::: info

The original statement could be shorter: "pi kama sona" could be dropped and the statement would be similar. Modifiers only make things more specific!

:::

</details>

You're observing the plants outside. Some are tall and wide, others are small and low to the ground. One plant in particular has many outstretched leaves glowing gently in the sun, and you remark on the shape of these leaves:

<details><summary> [kasi mute li ken lipu]{.tokipona} </summary>

Many plants can be papery.

Lots of leaves can be flat.

</details>

Every day, you come out to the edge of the water and watch the waves lap over the rocks and wash back out. As you come out day after day, you see that all the spots where water can reach are turning green- growing moss! You remark:

<details><summary> [telo li kama laso e kiwen]{.tokipona} </summary>

The water turned the rock green!

</details>

You're discussing a difficult decision with your family: do you leave your job, that has stressed you for months on end? You don't want to leave, because you know that will hurt your co-workers, and your friends, as they try to fill the gap you leave behind. Your brother chimes in with helpful perspective:

<details><summary> [wile sina li awen suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

Your wishes are still important.

Your wants are still important.

</details>

You're applying for a new job as a social media manager! You've been talking on about your experience and skills, but most importantly, you explain that you know the primary skill of a social media manager:

<details><summary> [mi sona pali e kulupu suli]{.tokipona} </summary>

I know how to create a huge community.

I am skilled at creating large groups.

I skillfully created a huge community!

</details>

You've been talking up Toki Pona with your friends for a while now, and finally convinced one of them to join you in learning! But your friend asks, why were you so persistent about others learning Toki Pona? You explain:

<details><summary> [jan pi toki pona li alasa nasa e kulupu ona  /  jan pi toki pona li lukin nasa e kulupu ona]{.tokipona} </summary>

Toki Pona speakers try to make their communities weird! [positive connotation]

Toki Pona speakers try to weird their communities.

::: info

Remember, pre-predicate [lukin]{.tokipona} and [alasa]{.tokipona} have the same meaning!

:::

</details>

#### Many pre-preds

Your friend is sick! Your other friends have been asking how your friend is doing, so you explain:

<details><summary> [ona li awen kama pona]{.tokipona} </summary>

They are still getting better.

</details>

You are watching your little brother stare into a triangular prism. Light is shining from the window into the prism, and the prism scatters all the light throughout the room in a variety of colors. Your brother says:

<details><summary> [mi wile alasa sona e kule ale  /  mi wile lukin sona e kule ale]{.tokipona} </summary>

I want to try understanding all the colors.

</details>

#### ala and pre-preds

Your research team has been working to put together a presentation. However, one member of your team will not be present on the day of the presentation- the one who was going to give it! You go to the coordinator and explain:

<details><summary> [ona li ken ala ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

They can't do this...

</details>

You've discovered you have a fascinating new power: You can grow plants wherever you point! But you can't make more than small blades of grass or patches of moss. As you discuss this with your teacher, they explain the roadblock you have:

<details><summary> [sina sona ala wawa e ken sina]{.tokipona} </summary>

You don't know how to empower your ability.

</details>

You've been feeling unwell lately, and sleeping a lot as a result. As the hours go by, and you're stuck in bed trying to recover, your responsibilities pile up. You unhappily remark to yourself:

<details><summary> [mi wile ala awen lape]{.tokipona} </summary>

I don't want to keep sleeping...

</details>

Your family has been clearing out a ton of space in the back yard, and carting all the extra leaves and branches to a pile. They burn the pile to get rid of it, and the smoke makes it a struggle to stay outside so you go in and settle into a book. Later, your brother comes to tell you they stopped:

<details><summary> [ona li awen ala seli e kasi]{.tokipona} </summary>

They stopped burning brush!

---

They're no longer burning plants!

::: info

You could also say "ona li seli ala e kasi" to similar effect!

:::

</details>

You're going swimming in a lake in the middle of summer! The sun is beaming brightly, and your dad is concerned you'll get a sunburn. He's reminded you too many times to bring sunscreen, put on lots of sunscreen, keep re-applying sunscreen, but you know all that already! You finally tell him:

<details><summary> [**mi alasa ala kama loje  /  mi lukin ala kama loje**]{.tokipona} </summary>

I'm not trying to get sunburnt!

::: info

You can apply pre-predicates to descriptions too!

:::

---

I'm not trying to turn red!

</details>

#### ala and other things

You've been sorting through boxes of donations, trying to make a list of contributors to thank for their help. Somebody you're working with you points out that you've made a mistake- you attributed a donation to the wrong person! They say:

<details><summary> [**ona li pana e ni ala・ona li pana e ni**]{.tokipona} </summary>

They didn't give this. They gave that!

::: info

While negating the predicate can be similar to negating the object, choosing one over the other can emphasize your intended meaning better!

:::

</details>

You're watching a friend confidently dive through piles of trash to find their lost hat. You're grossed out, but they insist they'll find it. Eventually, they come up from the pile with their hat! But the hat desperately needs to be washed after its garbage stint. Your friend tries to hand you the hat, and you exclaim:

<details><summary> [ni li jaki mute・mi pilin ala e ni]{.tokipona} </summary>

That is _so_ gross. I'm not touching that!

</details>

### English to Toki Pona

<details><summary> **I don't think anyone has the answer.** </summary>

[pilin mi li ni・jan ala li sona]{.tokipona}

[pilin mi li ni・jan li sona ala]{.tokipona}

[pilin mi li ni・ala li sona e ni]{.tokipona}

::: info

This one sentence needs to be broken up to accomplish two things: expressing that the statement is your feeling or thought, and the information of the statement itself!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> That glacier is not white! </summary>

[kiwen lete ni li walo ala]{.tokipona}

[lete ni li walo ala]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> I didn't do that! </summary>

[mi ni ala]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> I'm searching for my son </summary>

[mi alasa e jan lili mi]{.tokipona}

[mi alasa e jan ni・mi mama ona]{.tokipona}

::: info

The second example here uses a second sentence to add more information about the object!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> **The fire won't consume the forest!** </summary>

[seli li pakala ala e kulupu pi kasi suli]{.tokipona}

[seli li moku ala e kulupu kasi]{.tokipona}

[seli suli li moku ala e kasi ale]{.tokipona}

[seli wawa li moku ala e kasi ale]{.tokipona}

::: info

Even though "consume" is not meant in the eating sense here, moku still works!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> I'm still waiting! </summary>

[mi awen]{.tokipona}

::: info

You could say "mi awen awen" here, but "mi awen" already captures that!

:::

</details>

<details><summary> They're really good at that. </summary>

[ona li sona ni]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> My ears are still feeling really weird. </summary>

[kute mi li awen pilin nasa mute]{.tokipona}

[kute mi li awen nasa mute]{.tokipona}

[kute mi li awen nasa]{.tokipona}

</details>

<details><summary> This tree is ruining my view!  </summary>

[kasi ni li pakala e ken lukin mi]{.tokipona}

::: info

Here, a "view" is expressed as a looking ability. There are other ways to express this statement which we haven't learned yet; you could also say "I am unable to look because of this tree."

:::

</details>

<details><summary> Your moss garden is becoming pretty! </summary>

[kasi lili sina li kama pona]{.tokipona}

[ko kasi sina li kama pona]{.tokipona}

</details>

## Takeaway

#### Clarity of Grammar

If something is in the **predicate**, it will often be assumed to be an **action**. This is especially true when an **object** is present with [e]{.tokipona}.

If something is in the **object**, it will often be assumed to be a **thing**, especially something physical.

Neither of these are true _all_ the time, but they are true enough that you can rely on it! If you want to reference an action, putting that in the predicate can be helpful, and the same goes for putting physical things in the object.

Most of what pre-preds are used for can be said _without_ pre-preds. But using them makes you much more understandable.

#### Ambiguity

In this lesson, we saw that some phrases are **ambiguous**. There are multiple possible interpretations, statements that need more detail, and more. This is a common feature of Toki Pona. You do not need to specifically learn to avoid it- that will come naturally as you figure out what works and what doesn't!

That said, if any ambiguity or even simple misunderstanding comes up when speaking, restating yourself is helpful!
