#### Summary

People used to say `mi kepeken e ilo` to mean `I am using tools.` Now they say
`mi kepeken ilo`. `kepeken e` is always wrong as a result. But some people are
bringing back `kepeken e` for transitive prepositions, which is fun.

In the History section, I give a brief overview of the historical use of
kepeken. My involvement with the Toki Pona community only began in July of
2021, so I was not present for any historical practices of Toki Pona. However,
I have seen old lessons and documentation, particularly jan Pije's course, from
prior to pu. As such, I provide everything I know to be true as of today.

If you'd like to see how kepeken was taught as far back as 2006, check [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071017110330/http://bknight0.myweb.uga.edu/toki/lesson/lesson6.html)!

## History

Prior to Toki Pona: The Language of Good (pu), kepeken had a split history. The
word saw many distinct uses, both as a preposition and as a transitive verb.
These two uses appeared at different times and in different lessons, but the
commonality was that they were both used to mean `to use`. In other words, the
proper use of `kepeken` was _both_ as a transitive verb and a preposition at
various times, but they had the same meaning: `using.`

Since pu, kepeken has been taught as an exclusive preposition, never being a
transitive verb and rarely being used without an object as `mi kepeken`. pu
replaced all the previous ways kepeken was used with exactly one use with one
meaning: a preposition meaning `using`.

Modern use of kepeken has seen a small return to `kepeken e` in the form of
transitive prepositions, but these are rare.

## Proper use

The recommended use today is to say `mi kepeken ilo`, or `mi pali e tomo kepeken ilo`. `kepeken`, being a preposition, can appear in a `la` clause as
well. `kepeken e` is considered an error in all cases, and if it were
interpreted with a modern view of Toki Pona, it would read something like
`applying using to` in the same way other transitive verbs do.

As a reference on usage: in a (flimsy) comparison to English, consider the word
`using`: `I built a house using tools`. `Using` is not analyzed as a
preposition in English, but it serves a similar function of providing secondary
information about an action.

## Other Notes

There is some fringe use of `kepeken e` in the form of transitive prepositions!

Consider: `mi kepeken ilo e sina`. The core of the sentence is `mi kepeken e sina`, which would mean `I apply using to you`. The original has `kepeken ilo`,
`using tools`. If this is considered, the sentence now reads `I apply tool-using to you.` In other words, this is a concise way to say `I make you use tools.`
