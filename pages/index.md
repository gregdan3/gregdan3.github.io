## About Me

Hi! I'm Cassandra Cole.
I'm a part-time software engineer and physics student.
I also dabble in music and game development.

Welcome to my web page! 

Here you will find a small sample of some of the work that I've done or contributed to, as well as the occasional blog post. This site is still a work in progress, so expect things to change around here!
Please feel free to contact me if you're interested in collaborating on any creative projects!
