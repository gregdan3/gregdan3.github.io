ChatGPT has got me thinking lately....

# I'm tired of trying to reinvent the wheel

There's something to be said for someone who is able to produce a large
body of creative output from first principles. Certainly they must have
immense creative and critical thinking abilities. Innovation is expensive though.
By building on other's successes you can create new things for less cost.


Since I write software, I think about this a lot. All of the code I write
is built using complicated libraries for high-level languages that I only 
really understand small portions of. When I'm playing around with game dev,
all the engines I use are built on code bases that would take me years 
to truly understand. Obviously such projects are the product of many 
years and many people's efforts. Whenever I make something though, it feels like
I'm Duchamp drawing a moustache on the Mona Lisa - but without the wit.


When I was younger and about to start my first, ill-fated attempt at college, I
briefly contemplated going into music. I play guitar. I don't just play guitar, 
I **love** guitar. For a long time (and maybe still) I harbored dreams of being
a professional musician. Ultimately I decided to go into school for something else
entirely - something *practical*. But part of the reason for that was 
I didn't want to learn some bland, academic way of playing. In my arrogance, I thought
it would be better to learn as much as I could on my own rather than seek instruction
in a skill that meant a lot to me. I think maybe my dumb teenage brain thought
it was going to reinvent music from the ground up.


It's been a decade, and I can confidently say that hasn't been the case.


But this is an attitude that has followed me in other areas of my life.
I feel like maybe, I haven't earned it if I haven't worked through
the entire thing from bottom to top. If I were an automobile engineer, I
think some part of me would inevitably feel compelled to reinvent the 
windshield wiper, combustion engine, and of course the wheel. I almost
feel guilty taking hints from others, or basing my work off of theirs.


But there's a continuity to all these ideas that make up our world, regardless
of the domain they belong to; and it's kind of impossible to *really* build
something from first principles.


Making a small improvement to an existing thing is a humbling experience.
You've created something. And maybe you've created something really amazing!
But in that act you come to an awareness (not necessarily and understanding!)
of all the work that makes yours possible. Even more humbling is when you 
*don't* understand all the ground work of what you're doing.


But you can kind of endlessly dig into things you don't understand right? 
For example:

Your programming language is probably written in C,
which was bootstrapped using assembly. 

The assembly language in question probably depends on 
the architecture of the CPU in question.

CPU architecture... is complex and I don't really know
a lot about it! But at some point you're starting to ask 
electrical engineering questions about logic circuits.

Then you're asking physics questions about how conductors and
electrons and atoms work.

Now you're visiting CERN to ask them what atoms are made of.

Rough, but you get the idea.



I know it's a silly sense of pride, but sometimes it irks me to not be able to see
through the depths of this ocean I'm swimming in. I suppose it's better
that I swim instead of try to dive to the bottom though.


### good artists copy... 

This is all to say that I yanked the format for this static website
from my friend Greg's github.

[gregdan3's Site](https://github.com/gregdan3/gregdan3.github.io)

And I'm hurriedly scribbling as many moustaches as I can on *everything*.
